I added the dark mode toggle.
Since the site is already dark, I did the reverse and made it a light mode toggle.
I can't say it improves the estethic that much, but it works.
The CSS is too busy to add a dark mode toggle in a clean way.
I see the benefit of understanding your project scope and knowing up front that the client wants a dark mode option.
